## 🏗️ Architecture

This bot runs entirely on **GitHub Actions** with these benefits:
- ✅ **Zero Infrastructure**: No servers or hosting costs
- ✅ **Enterprise Ready**: Built-in security and compliance features  
- ✅ **Free Tier**: 2,000 minutes/month (more than enough)
- ✅ **Reliable**: GitHub's infrastructure handles uptime
- ✅ **Scalable**: Automatic error handling and notifications

### How It Works
1. **GitHub Actions runs every 5 minutes** during business hours
2. **Checks Google Calendar** for 1on1 meetings starting in 25-35 minutes  
3. **Pulls Zendesk metrics** for the meeting attendee (agent)
4. **Sends formatted report** to Slack with performance insights
5. **Uses service account authentication** for secure, automated access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Google Calendar Access**: Ensure calendar is shared with service account email
2. **Slack Permissions**: Ensure bot has `chat:write` permission and is added to target channel
3. **Zendesk Rate Limits**: Built-in error handling for API limits
4. **Agent Email Matching**: Ensure calendar attendee emails match Zendesk user emails

### Debug Mode
Run with `--check` flag to test without waiting for scheduled meetings:
```bash
python main.py --check
```

### 🚨 Security Requirements

#### **GitHub Actions Secrets**
When setting up repository secrets, ensure:

1. **Base64 Encode Google Credentials**:
   ```bash
   base64 -i credentials.json | pbcopy
   # Paste the result as GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON secret
   ```

2. **Use Least-Privilege Tokens**:
   - **Slack**: Only `chat:write` and `channels:read` scopes
   - **Zendesk**: Read-only API access for tickets and users
   - **Google**: Calendar read-only access

3. **Regular Token Rotation**:
   - Rotate API tokens quarterly
   - Monitor access logs for anomalies
   - Revoke unused tokens immediately

#### **Network Security**
- Deploy behind corporate firewall if required
- Use VPN for additional access control
- Monitor outbound connections to third-party APIs
- Consider API gateway for request filtering

#### **Compliance Considerations**
- **GDPR**: Agent emails and customer data are processed
- **SOC 2**: Audit logging and access controls implemented
- **HIPAA**: Additional encryption may be required for healthcare
- **PCI DSS**: No payment data is processed

### 🛡️ Security Best Practices

#### **For GitHub Actions Deployment**

1. **Enable Security Features**:
   ```yaml
   # In repository settings
   - Enable "Restrict pushes that create files"
   - Enable "Require signed commits"
   - Enable "Include administrators" for branch protection
   - Enable Dependabot alerts and security updates
   ```

2. **Monitor Actions Usage**:
   - Review workflow run logs regularly
   - Set up alerts for failed security checks
   - Monitor API rate limits and usage

3. **Secret Management**:
   - Never log secrets or environment variables
   - Use short-lived tokens when possible
   - Implement secret scanning in repositories

#### **For Self-Hosted Deployment**

1. **Infrastructure Security**:
   ```bash
   # Use dedicated service account
   sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false zendesk-slackbot
   
   # Secure file permissions
   chmod 600 .env
   chown zendesk-slackbot:zendesk-slackbot .env
   
   # Use systemd hardening
   [Service]
   User=zendesk-slackbot
   NoNewPrivileges=yes
   ProtectSystem=strict
   ProtectHome=yes
   ```

2. **Network Controls**:
   - Firewall rules for outbound connections only
   - VPN access for management
   - Regular security updates

3. **Monitoring & Logging**:
   ```python
   # Enable secure logging
   import logging
   logging.basicConfig(
       level=logging.INFO,
       format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - [REDACTED]',
       handlers=[
           logging.FileHandler('/var/log/zendesk-slackbot.log'),
           logging.StreamHandler()
       ]
   )
   ```

### 🔍 Security Monitoring

#### **Key Metrics to Monitor**
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns  
- Error rates and types
- Response times and timeouts
- Certificate expiration dates

#### **Alerting Setup**
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions monitoring
- name: Security Alert
  if: failure()
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    status: failure
    text: "🚨 Security incident detected in Zendesk Slackbot"
```

### 🚨 Incident Response

#### **In Case of Security Incident**

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Disable GitHub Actions workflows
   - Rotate all API tokens immediately
   - Review access logs for compromise
   - Notify security team

2. **Investigation**:
   - Collect logs from all systems
   - Check for data exfiltration
   - Review recent code changes
   - Audit user access

3. **Recovery**:
   - Deploy patched version
   - Update security controls
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update incident response plan
