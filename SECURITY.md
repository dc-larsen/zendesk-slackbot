# Security Policy

## Security Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Zendesk Slackbot, please report it responsibly.

### Reporting Process

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Create a GitHub issue with the 'security' label for vulnerability reports
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact and severity
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **24 hours**: Acknowledgment of your report
- **72 hours**: Initial assessment and severity classification
- **7 days**: Status update and estimated fix timeline
- **30 days**: Security patch released (for critical vulnerabilities)

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x     | ✅ Fully supported |
| < 1.0   | ❌ Not supported   |

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ HTTPS-only communication with SSL verification
- ✅ Environment variable-based credential management
- ✅ URL validation to prevent SSRF attacks
- ✅ Content sanitization for Slack messages
- ✅ Secure OAuth token handling
- ✅ Request timeouts and rate limiting considerations

### Security Considerations for Enterprise

- **Data Privacy**: Agent emails and ticket data are processed
- **Network Security**: Outbound connections to Slack, Zendesk, and Google APIs
- **Credential Management**: API tokens stored in GitHub Secrets
- **Logging**: Sensitive data is filtered from logs
- **Compliance**: Consider GDPR, SOC 2, and other regulatory requirements

## Security Best Practices

### For Deployment

1. **Secrets Management**:
   - Use GitHub repository secrets for API tokens
   - Base64 encode Google credentials
   - Rotate tokens regularly (quarterly recommended)
   - Use least-privilege API access

2. **Network Security**:
   - Deploy behind corporate firewall if required
   - Monitor outbound API connections
   - Use VPN for additional access control

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Enable GitHub security features (Dependabot, CodeQL)
   - Monitor workflow execution logs
   - Set up alerts for failed security checks

### For Development

1. **Code Security**:
   - Never commit credentials or secrets
   - Validate all external inputs
   - Use secure coding practices
   - Regular dependency updates

2. **Testing**:
   - Test with dummy/sandbox credentials
   - Verify input validation
   - Check error handling doesn't expose sensitive data

## Known Security Considerations

### Data Processing
- **PII Handling**: Agent emails are processed and may appear in logs
- **Customer Data**: Ticket subjects and comments are processed for CSAT analysis
- **Data Retention**: No persistent data storage beyond OAuth tokens

### Third-Party Dependencies
- Regular security scanning of dependencies
- Automatic updates for critical security patches
- Monitoring of security advisories

### GitHub Actions Security
- Secrets are handled in ephemeral environments
- OAuth tokens cached with run-specific keys
- Automatic cleanup of temporary credential files

## Incident Response

### If You Suspect a Security Breach

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Disable the GitHub Actions workflow
   - Rotate all API tokens (Slack, Zendesk, Google)
   - Review recent access logs

2. **Assessment**:
   - Determine scope of potential data exposure
   - Check for unauthorized API access
   - Review workflow execution history

3. **Recovery**:
   - Apply security patches if needed
   - Update compromised credentials
   - Document lessons learned

### Contact Information

For security-related inquiries:
- **GitHub Issues**: Use the 'security' label for vulnerability reports
- **Response Time**: Best effort (this is a personal project)

## Security Updates

Security updates will be announced through:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes with security tags
- Email notifications to repository watchers

## Compliance

This application processes the following types of data:
- Employee email addresses (agents)
- Customer support ticket metadata
- Customer satisfaction ratings and comments

Organizations should assess compliance requirements including:
- GDPR (EU data protection)
- CCPA (California privacy)
- SOC 2 (security controls)
- Industry-specific regulations
